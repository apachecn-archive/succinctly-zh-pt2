# 十一、总结

虽然我们已经到了这本书的结尾，但我真诚地希望这只是您 Python 之旅的开始。在过去十年中，Python 的受欢迎程度稳步增长，这是了解它的关键，因为它越来越多地被用于计算的所有领域。事实上，Python 为许多流行的网站提供了动力，如 Pinterest、Instagram 和 Reddit。Python 也用于科学计算，目前正在世界各地的超级计算机上运行。但是 Python 的使用可能比你知道的更深远。Python 用于系统管理任务，如配置和包管理(YUM 和 Anaconda 是主要的例子)，它还被用来创建流行的游戏，如 *EVE Online* 和 *Toontown* 。无论你的编程兴趣在哪个方向，Python 学习、探索和成长的可能性都是无穷无尽的。

这是最后一个 Python 程序。

            The Zen of Python, by Tim Peters

            Beautiful is better than ugly.
            Explicit is better than implicit.
            Simple is better than complex.
            Complex is better than complicated.
            Flat is better than nested.
            Sparse is better than dense.
            Readability counts.
            Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.
            Although practicality beats purity.
            Errors should n
            ever pass silently.
            Unless explicitly silenced.
            In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.
            There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.
            Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.
            Now is better than never.
            Although never is often better than *right* now.
            If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.
            If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.
            Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!
